# Word Pictures in the Book of Revelation
## Revealing Christ, Connecting to John, and Understanding God's Goal

---

## Introduction

The Book of Revelation is the most symbolic book in the New Testament, filled with vivid imagery drawn from the Old Testament prophets, Jewish apocalyptic literature, and the broader biblical narrative. These "word pictures" are not meant to confuse but to reveal—particularly to reveal the nature, work, and ultimate triumph of Jesus Christ. Many of these images find echoes in John's Gospel, suggesting a unified theological vision.
